## General Information

The purpose of this project was to test our knowledge based on skills learned to this point:

- JavaScript
- API's
- Ajax
- Jquery

## Technologies Used

- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Javascript
- Third Party API

## Setup

- ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
- New Git Hub Repo
- Read Me file
- script.js
- Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push

Once everything was setup, worked in VS Code to create a daily planning application
-Struggled to local storage to work
-Decided to keep the overall feel simple

## Project Status

Project is: _Continually being updated_. As i learn more JS, react, node etc, i will update this Planner in an attempt to make as dynamic as possible.

## Room for Improvement

I think we can further improve this by creating/using function local storage, which really is the entire purpose of this homework.  Could also incorporate full calendar functionality similar to an outlook, however for basic understanding this is good enough.

Room for improvement:
-I need more practice with all things JS, however it hasnt been as difficult as I initially thougt. Feels like a distant cousin to VBA.
